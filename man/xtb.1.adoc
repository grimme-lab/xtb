NAME
----

xtb - performs semiempirical quantummechanical calculations,
      for version 6.0 and newer

SYNOPSIS
--------

*xtb* ['OPTIONS'] 'FILE' ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The `xtb(1)` program performs semiempirical quantummechanical calculations.
The underlying effective Hamiltonian is derived from density functional
tight binding (DFTB). This implementation of the xTB Hamiltonian is currently
compatible with the zeroth, first and second level parametrisation for
geometries, frequencies and non-covalent interactions (GFN)
as well as with the ionisation potential and
electron affinity (IPEA) parametrisation of the GFN1 Hamiltonian.
The generalized born (GB) model with solvent accessable surface area (SASA)
is also available in this version.
Ground state calculations for the simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximation (sTDA)
with the vTB model are currently not implemented.

GEOMETRY INPUT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The wide variety of input formats for the geometry are supported by using
the mctc-lib. Supported formats are:

- Xmol/xyz files (xyz, log)
- Turbomole's coord, riper's periodic coord (tmol, coord)
- DFTB+ genFormat geometry inputs as cluster, supercell or fractional (gen)
- VASP's POSCAR/CONTCAR input files (vasp, poscar, contcar)
- Protein Database files, only single files (pdb)
- Connection table files, molfile (mol) and structure data format (sdf)
- Gaussian's external program input (ein)
- JSON input with `qcschema_molecule` or `qcschema_input` structure (json)
- FHI-AIMS' input files (geometry.in)
- Q-Chem molecule block inputs (qchem)

`xtb(1)` reads additionally `.CHRG` and `.UHF` files if present.

INPUT SOURCES
-------------
`xtb(1)` gets its information from different sources. The one with highest
priority is the commandline with all allowed flags and arguments described below.
The secondary source is the `xcontrol(7)` system, which can in principle
use as many input files as wished. The `xcontrol(7)` system is the successor
of the set-block as present in version 5.8.2 and earlier. This implementation
of `xtb(1)` reads the `xcontrol(7)` from two of three possible sources,
the local xcontrol file or the 'FILE' used to specify the geometry
and the global configuration file found in the `XTBPATH`.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
`xtb(1)` accesses a path-like variable to determine the location of its
parameter files, you have to provide the `XTBPATH` variable in the same
syntax as the system `PATH` variable. If this variable is not set, `xtb(1)`
will try to generate the `XTBPATH` from the deprecated `XTBHOME` variable.
In case the `XTBHOME` variable is not set it will be generated from the
`HOME` variable. So in principle storing the parameter files in the users
home directory is suffient but might lead to come cluttering.

Since the `XTBHOME` variable is deprecated with version 6.0 and newer
`xtb(1)` will issue a warning if `XTBHOME` is not part of the `XTBPATH`
since the `XTBHOME` variable is not used in production runs.

LOCAL FILES
-----------

`xtb(1)` accesses a number of local files in the current working directory
and also writes some output in specific files. Note that not all input
and output files allow the *--namespace* option.

   point charge embedding.

WARNINGS
--------
`xtb(1)` can generate the two types of warnings, the first warning section
is printed immediately after the normal banner at startup, summing up the
evaluation of all input sources (commandline, xcontrol, xtbrc). To check
this warnings exclusively before running an expensive calculation a
input check is implemented via the *--define* flag. Please, study this
warnings carefully!

After `xtb(1)` has evaluated the all input sources it immediately enters
the production mode. Severe errors will lead to an abnormal termination
which is signalled by the printout to STDERR and a non-zero return value
(usually 128). All non-fatal errors are summerized in the end of the calculation
in one block, right before the timing analysis.

To aid the user to fix the problems generating these warnings a brief
summary of each warning with its respective string representation in the
output will be shown here:

*ANCopt failed to converge the optimization*::
   geometry optimization has failed to converge in the given number
   optimization cycles. This is not neccessary a problem if only a
   small number of cycles was given for the optimization on purpose.
   All further calculations are done on the last geometry of the
   optimization.

*Hessian on incompletely optimized geometry!*::
   This warning will be issued twice, once before the Hessian,
   calculations starts (it would otherwise take some time before
   this this warning could be detected) and in the warning block
   in the end. The warning will be generated if the gradient norm
   on the given geometry is higher than a certain threshold.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
   normal termination of `xtb(1)`

*128*::
   Failure (termination via error stop generates 128 as return value)

BUGS
----
please report all bugs with an example input, `--copy` dump of internal settings
and the used geometry, as well as the `--verbose` output to xtb@thch.uni-bonn.de
