NAME
----
xtb - performs semiempirical quantummechanical calculations,
      for version 6.0 and newer

SYNOPSIS
--------
*xtb* ['OPTIONS'] 'FILE' ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `xtb(1)` program performs semiempirical quantummechanical calculations.
The underlying effective Hamiltonian is derived from density functional
tight binding (DFTB). This implementation of the xTB Hamiltonian is currently
compatible with the zeroth (6.1 only), first and second level parametrisation for
geometries, frequencies and non-covalent interactions (GFN)
as well as with the ionisation potential and
electron affinity (IPEA) parametrisation of the GFN1 Hamiltonian.
The generalized born (GB) model with solvent accessable surface area (SASA)
is also available available in this version.
Ground state calculations for the simplified Tamm-Danceoff approximation (sTDA)
with the vTB model are currently not implemented.

GEOMETRY INPUT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The input coordinates can be presented in XMOL format and
in Turbomole format. For most calculations no specific changes
to these formats have to be made.
The file type is determined automatically and the file extension
can be freely chosen. XMOL coordinates must be given in Ångström,
while in Turbomole format they can be given in Ångström as well
as in Bohr (default). The corresponding keyword is given in the
first line as `ang` or `bohr` instead of the `$coord` keyword.

NOTE: This implementation of `xtb(1)` can only identify and read coordinate
      files in Turbomole, if the `$coord` is in the first line of the
      file, valid Turbomole coordinate files with the `$coord` datagroup
      elsewhere will not be read in correctly and lead to abnormal termination
      of the program.

`xtb(1)` reads additionally `.CHRG` and `.UHF` files if present.

INPUT SOURCES
-------------
`xtb(1)` gets its information from different sources. The one with highest
priority is the commandline with all allowed flags and arguments described below.
The secondary source is the `xcontrol(7)` system, which can in principle
use as many input files as wished. The `xcontrol(7)` system is the successor
of the set-block as present in version 5.8.2 and earlier. This implementation
of `xtb(1)` reads the `xcontrol(7)` from two of three possible sources,
the local xcontrol file or the 'FILE' used to specify the geometry
and the global configuration file found in the `XTBPATH`.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
`xtb(1)` accesses a path-like variable to determine the location of its
parameter files, you have to provide the `XTBPATH` variable in the same
syntax as the system `PATH` variable. If this variable is not set, `xtb(1)`
will try to generate the `XTBPATH` from the deprecated `XTBHOME` variable.
In case the `XTBHOME` variable is not set it will be generated from the
`HOME` variable. So in principle storing the parameter files in the users
home directory is suffient but might lead to come cluttering.

Since the `XTBHOME` variable is deprecated with version 6.0 and newer
`xtb(1)` will issue a warning if `XTBHOME` is not part of the `XTBPATH`
since the `XTBHOME` variable is not used in production runs.

LOCAL FILES
-----------

`xtb(1)` accesses a number of local files in the current working directory
and also writes some output in specific files. Note that not all input
and output files allow the *--namespace* option.

*mdrestart*::

   are the cartesian coordinates and the last is an optional atom type.
   Note that the point charge input is not affected by a CMA transformation.
   Also parallel Hessian calculations will fail due to I/O errors when using
   point charge embedding.

WARNINGS
--------
`xtb(1)` can generate the two types of warnings, the first warning section
is printed immediately after the normal banner at startup, summing up the
evaluation of all input sources (commandline, xcontrol, xtbrc). To check
this warnings exclusively before running an expensive calculation a
input check is implemented via the *--define* flag. Please, study this
warnings carefully!

After `xtb(1)` has evaluated the all input sources it immediately enters
the production mode. Severe errors will lead to an abnormal termination
which is signalled by the printout to STDERR and a non-zero return value
(usually 128). All non-fatal errors are summerized in the end of the calculation
in one block, right bevor the timing analysis.

To aid the user to fix the problems generating these warnings a brief
summary of each warning with its respective string representation in the
output will be shown here:

*ANCopt failed to converge the optimization*::
   geometry optimization has failed to converge in the given number
   optimization cycles. This is not neccessary a problem if only a
   small number of cycles was given for the optimization on purpose.
   All further calculations are done on the last geometry of the
   optimization.

*Hessian on incompletely optimized geometry!*::
   This warning will be issued twice, once before the Hessian,
   calculations starts (it would otherwise take some time before
   this this warning could be detected) and in the warning block
   in the end. The warning will be generated if the gradient norm
   on the given geometry is higher than a certain threshold.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
   normal termination of `xtb(1)`

*128*::
   Failure (termination via error stop generates 128 as return value)

BUGS
----
please report all bugs with an example input, `--copy` dump of internal settings
and the used geometry, as well as the `--verbose` output to xtb@thch.uni-bonn.de
