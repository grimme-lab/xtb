XCONTROL(7)
===========
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
xcontrol - instruction file for `xtb(1)` version 6.0 and newer

SYNOPSIS
--------
xtb -I,--input *xcontrol* 'FILE'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `xcontrol(7)` instruction set is the successor of the set-block
present in `xtb(1)` version 5.8 and earlier. The used instruction
set is similar to the data groups in Turbomole or the detailed
input structure of ORCA. Every instruction is started by a flag (`$`)
and terminated by the next flag. A instruction is only valid if
the flag is in the first column, the instruction name is the rest
of the register. A valid instruction opens its blocks with its own
options, every option is a key-value pair.

There are two kind of instructions, logical and groups. Logical instructions
toggle a specific operation and cannot contain a option block while
group instructions only open the option block without any further actions.

A special instruction is the end instruction which is optional, as EOF
is a valid alternative in this implementation.

It should be noted that `xtb(1)` is able to produce `xcontrol(7)` instructions
by itself. You can tell `xtb(1)` by *--copy* to
save you original instructions, note that this implementation will strip all
comments while copying (print what you see, not what you read), to aid debugging.

$fit
~~~~
logical instruction to  set `xtb(1)` in `mfit(1)` compatibility mode
and prints out further informations.
This is a pure development feature and therefore should
be absent in every productive run.

$samerand
~~~~~~~~~
logical instruction to initialize the random number generator
with the same sequence

$chrg 'int'
~~~~~~~~~~~
set the charge of the molecule

$spin 'int'
~~~~~~~~~~~
set Nalpha-Nbeta of the molecule

$cma
~~~~
shifts molecule to center of mass and transforms cartesian coordinates
into the coordinate system of the principle axis (not affected by
`isotopes'-file).

$constrain

LEGACY
~~~~~~
To ensure compatibility with older versions of the `xtb(1)` prior to version 6.0
a group instruction set is allowed which accepts the same syntax as the
original set-block. Here we provide a list of set-block commands and their
corresponding instructions in `xcontrol(7)`.

NOTE: `xtb(1)` can read a set-block by itself and will print out a
      equivalent instruction set. This feature will be deprecated
      in future versions since the set-block is less flexible than
      `xcontrol(7)` and might be deactived without prior announcement!
