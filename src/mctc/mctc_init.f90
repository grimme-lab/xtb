!  here two important signal handlers are installed, it seems that

!  to do, but this will force it to die when I hit CTRL^C.
!  UPDATE: Since the FORTRAN standard does not specify which signals
!          are handled by the language, some compilers may handle no
!          signals at all. This is *non-standard* so it will break
!          your program on some platforms with some compilers!
