= Building xtb with CMake

To build `xtb` from the source in this repository the https://cmake.org/[CMake build system] can be employed.
The build files used require a CMake verson version of >= 3.9 or newer.
We highly recommend to use CMake together with the https://ninja-build.org/[ninja] (version 1.10 required), but the default make build will work as well.

== Getting CMake

CMake should be available in a sufficient up-to-date version from your operating systems package manager.
You can also use `conda` to install CMake and ninja from the conda-forge channel

[source,bash]
----
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install cmake ninja
----

Alternatively you can install the latest version of CMake and ninja with `pip` (or `pip3` depending on your system):

[source,bash]
----
pip install cmake ninja [--user]
----

== Configure Intel Fortran build with MKL

The recommended build for `xtb` is with Intel Parallel Studio using the Intel Fortran compiler and the Math Kernel Library as default backend.
Precompiled, statically linked `xtb` binaries for Linux are provided at https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb/releases/latest[release page].
With CMake 3.13 and newer the configuration can be conveniently performed from the repository root by

[source,bash]
----
export FC=ifort CC=icc
cmake -B_build -S. -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
----

For older versions of CMake use

[source,bash]
----
export FC=ifort CC=icc
mkdir _build
pushd _build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
popd
----

To build the project use

[source,bash]
----
ninja -C _build
----

Note, ninja will by default use all the threads available on your system.
If you share the build machine with others it might be helpful to reduce the number of concurrent jobs using the `-j` flag.
In case you prefer make leave out the `-GNinja` option and run

[source,bash]
----
make -C _build -j
----

to build the project.

== Configure GCC build

`xtb` can also be compiled with GCC version 8 or later.
The configuration with CMake 3.13 or newer can be performed conveniently with

[source,bash]
----
export FC=gfortran CC=gcc
cmake -B_build -S. -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
----

For older versions of CMake you have to use

[source,bash]
----
export FC=gfortran CC=gcc
mkdir _build
pushd _build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
popd
----

To compile and run `xtb` with GCC 7 (especially 7.3.0) the source code has to be patched at several placed, for appropriate patches visit the https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb-feedstock[conda-forge feedstock repository].
If you are compiling `xtb` on Darwin platforms, ensure that GCC is the actual GCC and not clang.
The build can be performed just like before:

[source,bash]
----
ninja -C _build
----

== Testing the build with CTest

After successfully building the `xtb` program ensure that it is working as expected.
Run the testsuite with

[source,bash]
----
ninja -C build test
----

If you have chosen make as generator use the same command with make.
All tests should pass, otherwise https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb/issues/new/choose[open an issue].

== Installing xtb with CMake

To use `xtb` in production or to pack a release with precompiled binaries the project should be installed with ninja.
The installation prefix defaults to `/usr/local` on Linux systems, you might want to adjust this first by configuring your build with

[source,bash]
----
cmake _build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local
----

To perform the actual installation run

[source,bash]
----
ninja -C _build install
----

If you have chosen make as generator use the same command with make.
Depending on the installation prefix and your user rights ninja/make might ask for the `root` access to perform the installation.
